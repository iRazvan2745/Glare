description: Centralized multi-worker backup orchestration for self-hosted infrastructure.
---

Glare is a monorepo application for orchestrating backups across multiple worker nodes.

## What Glare Includes

- `apps/web`: Next.js app for admin UI.
- `apps/server`: Elysia API for auth, worker management, plans, and orchestration.
- `apps/worker`: Rust + Axum service that executes backup commands locally.
- `packages/db`: Drizzle schema + migrations for all persistent state.
- `packages/auth` and `packages/env`: shared auth and config utilities.

## Backup Execution Model (Current)

Backup jobs are **scheduled and executed by workers** from synced plans:

1. Workers sync assigned backup plans from server.
2. Workers evaluate cron locally.
3. Workers execute `rustic backup` locally when due.
4. Workers report run results back to server.

This lets workers continue running schedules even if the server is temporarily unavailable.
