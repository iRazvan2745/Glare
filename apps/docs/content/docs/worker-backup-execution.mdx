title: Worker Backup Execution
description: Worker-owned scheduling via plan sync and local cron execution.
---

## Flow

1. Worker calls `POST /api/workers/backup-plans/sync`.
2. Server returns assigned plans with worker-ready backup request payload.
3. Worker caches plans locally.
4. Worker evaluates cron expressions locally.
5. On due tick, worker runs backup.
6. Worker reports result via `POST /api/workers/backup-plans/:id/report`.
7. Server records run + event and updates plan status.

## Worker Auth Endpoints

- `POST /api/workers/sync`
- `POST /api/workers/backup-plans/sync`
- `POST /api/workers/backup-plans/:id/report`

## Notes

- Scheduler ownership is worker-side.
- Server-side scheduler is disabled by default.
- Result replay outbox is not implemented yet.
