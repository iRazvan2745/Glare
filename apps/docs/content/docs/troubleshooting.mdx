## Worker Offline

- Verify worker process is running.
- Verify `--master-api-endpoint` connectivity.

## Plans Not Executing

- Confirm worker receives plans from `/backup-plans/sync`.
- Confirm cron expressions are valid 5-part cron.
- Check worker logs for cron parse failures.

## Reports Failing

- Check worker can reach server.
- Check sync token not rotated without worker restart.
- Inspect server logs for auth/payload rejection.

## `rustic`/`rclone` Errors

- Verify binaries are installed in worker runtime.
- Validate backend/options/repository path.
- Confirm repository credentials.
