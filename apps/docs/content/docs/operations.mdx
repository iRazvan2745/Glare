## Add a Worker

1. Create worker in UI/API.
2. Capture sync token.
3. Start worker with master endpoint, local endpoint, token.
4. Confirm worker status is online.

## Rotate Worker Token

1. `POST /api/workers/:id/rotate-sync-token`
2. Restart worker with new token.
3. Verify heartbeat and plan sync resume.

## Verify Plan Sync

- Check worker logs for successful `backup plans synced` messages.
- Confirm worker has assigned plans and valid cron.

## Verify Execution

- Check `backup_plan_run` rows appear for worker reports.
- Check `backup_event` rows for success/failure transitions.
- Check plan `lastStatus`, `lastError`, `lastDurationMs` updates.
